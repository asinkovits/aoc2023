# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles, written in Java.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate classes for each day's puzzles. Each class implements the `AdventOfCodeDailyExercise` interface, which has two methods: `solveFirst` and `solveSecond`. These methods solve the first and second parts of the day's puzzle, respectively.

The `Main` class runs all the exercises.

## Running the Project

You can run the project using Gradle. To run the exercises for a specific day, use the `gradle run` command with the day number as an argument. For example, to run the exercises for day 1, use the command `gradle run --args='1'`.
